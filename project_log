Deciding on models for SQLite database. I think we want the RFID string to serve as teh lookup key in our database of items.

I made a "foreign key" called "batch," which I added to our database. This is a many-one relation - different items can have the same batch. Note that the batch must be set up first.

we should make some constructor methods to quicken the process of setting these things up (e.g. make it easy to set the expdates and such.)

Question for the future: Django's SQLite comes with the development server. Should we migrate to mySql? So far I love SQLite...
